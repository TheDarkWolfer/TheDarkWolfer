# Who am I ?
Hi there, I'm Camille, a French cybersecurity enthusiast and computer science student. 
Currently working on a BTS SIO, I also spend a lot of time tinkering around with Linux, and spend a lot of time learning and practicing cybersecurity-related skills, like system hardening, OPSEC and/or OSINT, log analysis and the occasional CTF.

I also know a few programming languages, and plan on adding more to that list :
- Python    (which I use for automation and quick one-off scripts)
- Go        (I really like to use this one when I need control over a specific operation and good performance)
- Bash      (really love the portable aspect of bash, which I try to take advantage of by making most of my scripts either use no external dependencies or as little as possible)

# What am I good at ?
As said above, I take a great deal of interest in cybersecurity, and I find great pride in the security of my devices. I've been running Linux for a while and have been managing my own little network for a while, with little to no hiccups for a few years. I've also been studying for INE's eJPT, and plan on passing in soon enough.
